A simple project to learn the basics of React, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Practiced using components and hooks to save state and fetch details from an API.

The app pulls in posts from the subReddit 'r/reactjs', and tells you how many upvotes they each have.
